# Location Key Validation Update

## Summary

Added automatic runtime validation to the `client-api` library that prevents location keys from being passed in the wrong order. This validation throws a clear, actionable error message instead of silently generating malformed URL paths.

## Problem Being Solved

Previously, if location keys were passed in the wrong order (e.g., `[orderFormKey, orderKey]` instead of `[orderKey, orderFormKey]`), the library would silently generate a malformed URL path like:
```
/orderForm/26693/fjell/order/26669/orderNoseShape
```

Instead of the correct:
```
/fjell/order/26669/orderForm/26693/orderNoseShape
```

This resulted in 404 errors that were difficult to debug.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Runtime Validation Function

Added `validateLocationKeyOrder()` in `src/Utilities.ts` that:
- Extracts location keys from the provided keys array
- Builds a map of key types to their expected hierarchy position
- Validates that location keys appear in strictly ascending order
- Handles path segments with slashes (e.g., "fjell/order" correctly matches key type "order")
- Throws a descriptive error if validation fails

### 2. Validation Error Message

When keys are out of order, users get a clear error:
```
Error: Location keys must be ordered from parent to child according to the entity hierarchy.
Expected order based on pathNames: [fjell/order, orderForm, orderNoseShape].
Received key types in order: [orderForm, order].
Key "order" is out of order - it should appear earlier in the hierarchy.
```

### 3. Test Coverage

Added comprehensive tests in `tests/Utilities.test.ts`:
- ✅ `should generate path for nested entities with correct order`
- ✅ `should generate path for collection access with location keys only`
- ✅ `should throw error when location keys are in wrong order`
- ✅ `should throw error with helpful message explaining the issue`

### 4. Documentation

Created/updated documentation:
- `LOCATION_KEY_ORDERING.md` - Complete guide on location key ordering with examples
- Explains the validation, shows correct vs incorrect usage
- Documents benefits and implementation details

## Benefits

1. **Fail Fast**: Errors caught at API call site, not after HTTP request
2. **Clear Error Messages**: Tells exactly what's wrong and the correct order
3. **Prevents Debugging Confusion**: No more hunting through logs for 404 causes
4. **Type-Safe + Runtime Safe**: TypeScript types prevent wrong order at compile time, runtime validation catches dynamic cases
5. **Zero Performance Cost for Correct Code**: Validation only runs when building paths

## Backwards Compatibility

✅ **Fully backwards compatible** - only throws errors for code that was already broken (passing keys in wrong order, which would have resulted in 404s)

## Files Changed

1. `src/Utilities.ts` - Added `validateLocationKeyOrder()` function and integrated it into `getPath()`
2. `tests/Utilities.test.ts` - Added 4 new tests for validation behavior
3. `LOCATION_KEY_ORDERING.md` - New comprehensive documentation
4. `LOCATION_KEY_VALIDATION_UPDATE.md` - This summary document

## Test Results

All 302 tests pass across the entire test suite:
```
Test Files  22 passed (22)
Tests  302 passed (302)
```

Coverage for `Utilities.ts`: **94.97%**

## Example Usage

### Before (Silent Failure)
```typescript
const locations = [orderFormKey, orderKey]; // Wrong order!
const items = await api.one({}, locations);
// Result: 404 error with confusing path
```

### After (Clear Error)
```typescript
const locations = [orderFormKey, orderKey]; // Wrong order!
const items = await api.one({}, locations);
// Throws immediately:
// Error: Location keys must be ordered from parent to child...
```

### Correct Usage
```typescript
const locations = [orderKey, orderFormKey]; // Correct order!
const items = await api.one({}, locations);
// Result: Success! ✅
```

## Recommendation for Your Project

In your other project where you're experiencing the path ordering issue:

1. **Update the `@fjell/client-api` dependency** to get this validation
2. **Run your code** - the validation will immediately show you where keys are in wrong order
3. **Fix the order** based on the error messages
4. **Verify** the fix by checking that API calls succeed

The validation will pinpoint exactly which API calls have keys in the wrong order and what the correct order should be.
